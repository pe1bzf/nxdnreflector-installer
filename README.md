One-step NXDNReflector installer for Raspberry Pi OS
Based on the repository DVReflector from nostar
Made with a lot of help from chatGPT ;-)

Install a lite version of the raspberry OS (full version will also work, bud with overhead)
user mmdvm
copy install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh into home directory
chmod +x install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh
sudo bash install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh

Watch the show en enjoy.

Post install:
goto <IP-ADDRESS>/NXDNReflector-Dashboard2/setup.php
edit /etc/NXDVReflector.ini for your own used reflector number 
enable via DVref.com
