One-step NXDNReflector installer for Raspberry Pi OS

Based on the repository DVReflector from nostar

Made with a lot of help from chatGPT ;-)


Install a lite version of the raspberry OS (full version will also work, bud with overhead)

user mmdvm

copy install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh into home directory

        sudo chmod +x install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh
        sudo dos2unix install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh (if necessary)
        sudo bash install_nxdn_all_in_one.sh

   Watch the show en enjoy.

Post install: (script polished for maximum convenience)

follow instructions on screen
